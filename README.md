- `Header`: Displays the storefront's title.
- `Footer`: Shows the copyright and contact information.
- `Categories`: Lists all product categories and allows users to select a category.
- `Products`: Displays products based on the selected category.
- `ActiveCategory`: Shows the currently selected category and its details.
