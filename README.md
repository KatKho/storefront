# Storefront

The Storefront application is a fully functional e-commerce storefront built using React with Redux, showcasing a list of products that users can add to a shopping cart.

## Project Structure

The application is divided into various components, each responsible for a part of the application's functionality:

- `Header`: Displays the storefront's title and a cart indicator showing the number of items in the cart.
- `Footer`: Shows copyright and contact information.
- `Categories`: Lists all product categories. Users can select a category to filter the product list.
- `Products`: Displays products based on the selected category. Users can add products to their cart.
- `ActiveCategory`: Shows the name and description of the currently selected category.
- `SimpleCart`: A cart component that gives users a total number of the items they have added to their cart.
- `CartList`: Details each product added to the cart, including name and quantity, and allows users to remove items from the cart.
